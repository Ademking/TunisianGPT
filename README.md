This website is just for fun! This project does not actually use ChatGPT or any other form of AI.

Despite not using any AI, this website promises to bring you just as much enjoyment as the real thing ðŸ¤£.

So why not give it a try and see for yourself? You might be surprised at the funny and engaging conversations you can have.
